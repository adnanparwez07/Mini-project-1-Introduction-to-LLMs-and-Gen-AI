# 📊 Sentiment Analysis for E-Commerce Customer Reviews  

## 📌 Project Overview  
In today’s fast-paced e-commerce landscape, **customer reviews** significantly shape product perception and buying decisions. Businesses that fail to analyze and respond to customer sentiment risk **churn, reputation damage, and financial loss**.  

This project implements an **AI-driven sentiment classification model** to automatically categorize customer reviews into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**, enabling the business to monitor customer feedback at scale and make data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
A growing e-commerce platform specializing in **electronic gadgets** faced:  
- **200% growth** in their customer base over three years  
- **25% spike** in customer feedback volume  

The manual process of analyzing feedback became unsustainable.  
The goal is to **build a predictive model** that can classify customer sentiments automatically.

## 📂 Data Dictionary  
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product  
- **Product Review**: Customer’s feedback/opinion on the product  
- **Sentiment**: Target variable → *Positive / Negative / Neutral*

## 🛠️ Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Text cleaning (stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)  
   - Tokenization  
   - Handling imbalanced data if necessary  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Word clouds, sentiment distribution  
   - Most frequent words in positive vs. negative reviews  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Bag of Words (BoW)  
   - TF-IDF vectorization  
   - Word embeddings (optional for deep learning models)  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Classical ML models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM  
   - Deep Learning: LSTM/GRU (optional)  
   - Transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa, optional advanced step)  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Expected Outcomes  
- Automated sentiment classification system  
- Insights into customer feedback trends  
- Actionable intelligence for business decision-making  

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK/Spacy, Matplotlib/Seaborn  
- **ML/DL Models**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM, (optionally BERT)  
- **IDE/Tools**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
